# React: Working with 3D Graphics
![](https://i.ibb.co/Wsm13jm/image.png)

This repository explores the integration of 3D graphics into React applications. We will be utilizing the following libraries and tools:

## Libraries

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library that simplifies the use of WebGL.
- **React Three Fiber**: An abstraction over Three.js for React, providing components for 3D rendering.
- **React Three Drei**: An abstraction over React Three Fiber, offering a set of helpful functions and components.
- **glTF Pipeline**: A command-line interface (CLI) for optimizing glTF files.
- **glTFJSX**: A CLI for converting glTF models into React components.

## Features

- Seamless integration of 3D graphics into React applications.
- Utilization of powerful 3D rendering libraries like Three.js and React Three Fiber.
- Optimization of 3D assets using the glTF Pipeline.
- Conversion of 3D models into reusable React components with glTFJSX.
- Exploration of advanced 3D techniques and interactions.
